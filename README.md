	<li>TaroNuke - Help with the PlayerMod String.</li>
<p style="width: 90%">Thanks to him, i was able to make the PlayerMods string be a Text Layer controled by the Overlay, and not by the engine, allowing it to be hidden by just doing <b>SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen():GetChild('Overlay'):hidden(1)</b> for Mod songs.</p>

   <li>CosmicLAER - Suggestions with the Narrator
<p style="width: 90%">She suggested some useful stuff for the narrator feature in DWI, so i added a feature to <b>Actually</b> disable the narrator if it becomes annoying.
<br><i>In the original DWI, there was a option to "Disable" the announcer, but it didn't disable all of it.</i></p></LI>

   <li>LDanii2000 - Help with the DWI Noteskins
<p style="width: 90%">Thanks to him, for pointing it out, <i>(and even fixing it for me without telling me)</i>, he fixed a little error with DWIDance that prevented Solo play, which was something with the holds.</p></li>

   <li>Sora - Help with Lua commands
<p style="width: 90%">Also to him, THANK YOU SO MUCH for making the OITG/NITG Lua API page. I pretty much use it all the time when making all kinds of stuff for OpenITG/NotITG.</p></li>

   <li>BrotherMojo - Help with Lua commands
<p style="width: 90%">He helped with the WideScreen command. Pretty much also starting the "we don't need floors" gag from the same lua function.</p></li>

   <li>MadkaT - Help with 16:9 Textures, Lua Optimizations
<p style="width: 90%">He helped me with this theme, since the very beginning, and also when i released the first public beta. Without him, I wouldn't have known some commands, and some of the 16:9 textures, as he was making a SM5 version of the theme at the same time as i did!</p></li>
   
   <li>HowTo Step?, Kirby5464 and Crazybozo7 for testing the theme and pointing out bugs.
